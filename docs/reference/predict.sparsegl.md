# Make predictions from a \`sparsegl\` object.

Similar to other predict methods, this function produces fitted values
and class labels from a fitted \[\`sparsegl\`\] object.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'sparsegl'
predict(
  object,
  newx,
  s = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response", "coefficients", "nonzero", "class"),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  Fitted \[sparsegl()\] model object.

- newx:

  Matrix of new values for \`x\` at which predictions are to be made.
  Must be a matrix. This argument is mandatory.

- s:

  Value(s) of the penalty parameter \`lambda\` at which predictions are
  required. Default is the entire sequence used to create the model.

- type:

  Type of prediction required. Type \`"link"\` gives the linear
  predictors for \`"binomial"\`; for \`"gaussian"\` models it gives the
  fitted values. Type \`"response"\` gives predictions on the scale of
  the response (for example, fitted probabilities for \`"binomial"\`);
  for \`"gaussian"\` type \`"response"\` is equivalent to type
  \`"link"\`. Type \`"coefficients"\` computes the coefficients at the
  requested values for \`s\`. Type \`"class"\` applies only to
  \`"binomial"\` models, and produces the class label corresponding to
  the maximum probability. Type \`"nonzero"\` returns a list of the
  indices of the nonzero coefficients for each value of `s`.

- ...:

  Not used.

## Value

The object returned depends on type.

## Details

\`s\` is the new vector of \`lambda\` values at which predictions are
requested. If \`s\` is not in the lambda sequence used for fitting the
model, the \`coef\` function will use linear interpolation to make
predictions. The new values are interpolated using a fraction of
coefficients from both left and right \`lambda\` indices.
