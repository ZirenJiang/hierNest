# Create starting values for iterative reweighted least squares

This function may be used to create potentially valid starting values
for calling \[sparsegl()\] with a \[stats::family()\] object. It is not
typically necessary to call this function (as it is used internally to
create some), but in some cases, especially with custom generalized
linear models, it may improve performance.

## Usage

``` r
make_irls_warmup(nobs, nvars, b0 = 0, beta = double(nvars), r = double(nobs))
```

## Arguments

- nobs:

  Number of observations in the response (or rows in \`x\`).

- nvars:

  Number of columns in \`x\`

- b0:

  Scalar. Initial value for the intercept.

- beta:

  Vector. Initial values for the coefficients. Must be length \`nvars\`
  (or a scalar).

- r:

  Vector. Initial values for the deviance residuals. Must be length
  \`nobs\` (or a scalar).

## Value

List of class \`irlsspgl_warmup\`

## Details

Occasionally, the irls fitting routine may fail with an admonition to
create valid starting values.
